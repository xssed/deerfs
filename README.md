## deerfs requires support for the following services
- owlcache
- mysql(Data table file path:deerfs_service/sql/table.sql)

## Upload and download permissions
Deerfs focuses more on functionality. As a standalone service, it needs to access a variety of different platforms. Permission verification is different on each platform, so you need to modify the source code to implement it yourself. Or perform permission verification on the gateway.
